# Mongo Todo List

In this Lab, you'll take a basic TODO application that saves TODOs to a JSON file and you'll replace it with Mongoose to instead save the TODOs to Mongo Database.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm test` - run test suite
* `npm start` - run the REPL

##Requirements

Remove the todos array completely and use Mongoose methods in all of the CRUD functions.

You can define the TODO Schema in the same `models/todo.js` file.

## Bonus

Use Mongoose Validations to ensure that only valid TODOs are saved.
